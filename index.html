	Hi! I’m <strong>Jaswanth Veeragantla</strong>, results-driven <strong>Software Developer, Data Analyst, and Machine Learning Practitioner</strong> 
	with a Master’s degree in Information Science. I specialize in designing and implementing <strong>data-driven solutions</strong> that convert complex datasets 
	into actionable insights and intelligent systems. My expertise spans <strong>ETL pipeline development, data engineering, dashboard automation,</strong> and 
	<strong>AI model deployment</strong> across cloud platforms.
	<br><br>
	Currently, I’m working as a <strong>Software Developer </strong>, where I build and optimize scalable backend and data processing systems. 
	I’m passionate about leveraging technologies like <strong>Python, Java, SQL, Power BI, AWS, and Azure</strong> to enable smarter, data-informed decision-making. 
	I thrive on solving complex problems, automating workflows, and transforming raw data into clear, strategic insights that drive innovation and business impact.
